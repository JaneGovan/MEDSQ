Mild aortic distortion refers to a slight twisting of the aorta seen on the X-ray. Uneven density in the retrocardiac shadow indicates abnormal density in the postcardiac area. Uneven density at the base refers to abnormal density at the base of the lung. Atelectasis is a lung disease caused by incomplete air absorption in the alveoli or alveolar collapse. Pleural effusion refers to an excessive accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity. Pneumothorax refers to the abnormal accumulation of gas in the pleural cavity."
